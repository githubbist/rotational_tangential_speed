# rotational_tangential_speed
A simple calculator that converts rotational to tangential speed (and vice versa).

# Inputs
This calculator is intended to display the relationship between the rotational speed and tangential velocity of a rotating object. The calculator requires three inputs to generate a solution. The first input is the diameter of the rotating object. The second input is the radio button to indicate which value is known (rotational speed or tangential speed). The third input is the rotational speed or tangential speed. Once the values are filled out, the user will select "Calculate" and the solution will display in the green disabled Entry widget.

#Code
This program utilizes the MVC Design pattern.
